# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Week 4 course project

This repo has a codebook that is a copy of the README.txt from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The run_analysis.R file does not contain the initial unzip codes or the install.packages that was done for data.table and plyr. Only the answers to the 5 steps asked in the project is shown in the .R file
